# TSL NIGERIA Streamit API

## Welcome to TSL Nigeria API.

The API has a couple of endpoints that gives you access to the database. The base URL allows you to make requests along side sub-endpoints or paths.

### Base URL

```
https://web-production-93c3.up.railway.app/
```

Note that every endpoint must have an ending slash. This shows that it is an absolute URL. With the base URL above, requests can be made to various endpoints.

## Requests and Responses

This API gives you access to create and authenticate users, add and remove videos, categories, like videos, add videos to favourites, list and display videos and categories, user profiles and details, et cetera.


# GET - /profiles/

The fields existing for uploading a profile are `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `profile_photo`, `bio`, `country`, `gender` and `phone_number`. None of these fields are required. It is advisable to only make queries with `user_id`, not modify it. You can query the user profile via the `user_id` if your intention is to get the user's profile details. `user_details` is automatically generated from the user object. This is because a Profile object is created alongside a User object by default. Hence, the user_id and profile_id are the same.
Do not send a POST request to the profile object. POST request is not permitted. You can only send a POST request to the user, i.e. WHEN YOUR INTENTION IS TO CREATE A USER. Use a PUT request instead.
A PUT request is ideal for updating the user profile.

This means that you can use the user_id or profile_id interchangeably. We do this to ensure that every user instance is connected to a Profile object. You can make your queries with the endpoints below:
For list view:

```
{Base_Url}/profiles/
```

The above request will fetch you all the user profiles in the database.

# PUT, GET, DELETE - /profiles/:id/

For detail view:

```
{Base_Url}/profiles/{id}/
```

## Request via PUT

You can choose to modify any of the following via a PUT request.

```json
{
  "username": "",
  "first_name": "",
  "last_name": "",
  "profile_photo": "/path/to/media/file",
  "bio": "",
  "country": "",
  "gender": "",
  "phone_number": ""
}
```

Note that every PUT request made gives you back the same object.
If you wish to give back a custom reponse to your user. You can make use of your status_code attribute.
Every successfully request has a status code of 200.

## Response via GET

```json
{
  "user_details": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "peter@gmail.com",
    "is_superuser": true,

```
{Base_Url}/videos/
```

The above gives you the array (or list) of videos and their respected a respective `id`, `title`, `thumbnail`, `author`, `category`,`likes`, `date_uploaded`, `last_modified`, etc. A typical response from a GET request is as follows:

When sending a POST request to a upload a video file, it is mandatory to use a form data instance. Since images are also uploaded via a POST request, the `Content-Type` header must be `multipart/form-data` as opposed to `application/json`.
A typical POST request can be sent in the following format:

```json
{
"title":"string",
"category":"id",
"age_rating":"number",
"playlist":"id"
"_actors":"[list[id]]"
"director":"id",
"desktop_thumbnail":"image",
"mobile_thumbnail":"image",
"mobile_banner":"image",
"desktop_banner":"image",
"_genres":"[list[id]]",
"_moods":"[list[id]]",
"video_link":"url",
"description":"string",
"author":"id",
"publish":"bool",
}
```

# How to Implement User Feedback Functionality

The goal of every commercial application is to serve and satisfy users. How we know our users
are satisfied with our content is when they give us feedback on how our app benefits them.
The most common, viable and effective way to get users' feedback is when they `like` our video posts or add a few of them to their list of favourites.

## POST /videos/:id/likes/

Here, you are only required to send the `user_id` as follows:

```json
{
  "user_id": "1"
}
```

Yes, it is that simple! Sending a simple POST request with the above json body will do.
How we are able to determine which video was liked is in the url. The `:id` parameter is a number that represents the
`video_id`. By specifying a numerical value in the url helps identify the video a particular user likes.
If the `user_id` and the `video_id` exists, the state of the user's `like` instance changes. Either of the following
responses are gotten from our API depending on the state of the user's like instance.

```python
{
  "detail": "peter@gmail.com liked NameOfVideo"
}
# or
{
  "detail": "peter@gmail.com unliked NameOfVideo"
}
```

If, on the other hand, a video or a user with the specified ids do not exist,
an `invalid video and user id` response is sent back.

```json
{
  "details": "Invalid video_id and user_id"
}
```

A video can also be added to users' `favourites` using the same convention.

## POST /videos/:id/favourites/

Here, the users can add videos to their list of `favourites`. Such videos would be seen in their profile,
although the client side can use this however way they wish. The only difference that exists between adding to `favourites` and
`liking` a particular video is that `profile_id` is used in this case instead of the `user_id`.
The video to be added to a given list is represented by the `id` parameter in the url.
The expected request can be send via a `profile_id`.

```json
{
  "profile_id": "1"
}
```

The following responses are gotten from our API depending on the state of the user's addition to their list of favourites:

```json
{
  "detail": "dan@gmail.com added NameOfVideo to list"
}
// or
{
  "detail": "dan@gmail.com removed NameOfVideo from list"
}
```
